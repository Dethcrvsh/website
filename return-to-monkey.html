            <h3>> LIU Game Jam</h3>
            <p>
                Over the years, I have been part of my fair share of game jams. For the last two, I have actually helped
                organize them! It is an event hosted by
                <a href="https://en.lithekod.se/gamejam/">LiTHe Kod</a> where
                the
                goal is to create a game in 48h hours. This encompasses both creating the ideas, programming, art,
                music,
                game design, and more. During the jams, I have mostly focused on the aspects of game design and
                programming,
                but have also contributed a bit of music here and there.
            </p>
            <h3>> About the Game</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Återvänd till Apa</b> is a sudden death action shooter where you play as monkeys, running around in a
                tree, shooting each other with bananas. It was our first multiplayer game, which makes it fun by
                definition! I won't get in to too much detail since I wasn't very involved with this game. However, the
                funniest part about it was by far the monkey space program. One of the features was that the monkeys
                could climb on the roofs and walls of the tree. One side effect of this was that they could also climb
                on each other! If two players timed it well and started climbing on each other at the same time, they
                could travel indefinitely into the air. We added a moon far above the level just for this purpose as a
                fun easter egg.
