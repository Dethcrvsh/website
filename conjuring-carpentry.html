            <h3>> LIU Game Jam</h3>
            <p>
                Over the years, I have been part of my fair share of game jams. For the last two, I have actually helped
                organize them! It is an event hosted by
                <a href="https://en.lithekod.se/gamejam/">LiTHe Kod</a> where
                the
                goal is to create a game in 48h hours. This encompasses both creating the ideas, programming, art,
                music,
                game design, and more. During the jams, I have mostly focused on the aspects of game design and
                programming,
                but have also contributed a bit of music here and there.

            <h3>> About the Game</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Conjuring Carpentry</b> is a survival tower defence game where you play as a carpenter with magical
                powers. In the daytime, you wander around the woods, chopping down trees and crafting beautiful
                furniture. At night, your creations come alive to defend you against the horrors of the forest.

                I still think the original idea was great, but it was far too ambitious for a game jam. Since we barely
                had time to playtest, the furniture and the waves of enemies were very unbalanced. One of the furniture
                even crashes all enemies on the whole map (we still have no idea how that happened). I spent most of my
                time working on the enemy AI and the wave spawning mechanism. On a positive note, I finally managed to
                    get A* path finding working in <a href="https://godotengine.org">Godot!</a>
