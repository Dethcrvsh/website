            <p>Hello, I'm Dethcrvsh, a 23-year-old student currently working towards my Master of Science in 
            Computer Science and Software Engineering at Linköping University. This website is supposed to serve 
            as a digital resumee of sorts as well as a place for my old projects to live. As of now, it's EXTREMELY
            unfinished. In the meantime, here's my <a href="https://github.com/Dethcrvsh">Github</a> 
            and some old <a href="game-jam.html">Game Jam projects</a> I have been a part of.</p>
