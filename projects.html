            <p>
                Over the years, I have been part of my fair share of game jams. It is an event
                hosted by <a href="https://en.lithekod.se/gamejam/">LiTHe Kod</a> where
                the goal is to create a game in 48h hours. This encompasses both creating
                the ideas, programming, art, music, game design, and more. During the jams, I
                have mostly focused on the aspects of game design and programming, but have also
                contributed a bit of music here and there.

                Egg Sandwich Adventures: DX. The Chronicles of the Caviar. Chapter II (yes, we
                thought we were very funny coming up with that) is a simple <b>horror adventure</b>
                where you play as an egg sandwich. Your goal is to venture off and find
                <b>dragon eggs</b> to be able to grow bigger and stronger. The issue is that the eggs
                are guarded by <b>Bolibompadraken</b>! They will try to fry the sandwich using their
                fiery breath. But by <b>throwing tomatoes</b> and <b>squirting caviar</b>, the sandwich
                is able to level out the playing field.
                <br><br>
                This was my first ever project in <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a>, meaning
                I spent most of my time trying to learn the engine. I immediately became over ambitious
                and tried implementing the <b>A* Path Finding Algorithm</b> for the dragons.
                After a whole day of work, I gave up and the dragons had to navigate using <b>rays</b>
                instead. <b>Bolibompadraken</b> was just meant to be a placeholder by the way,
                but in the end, we thought they were too funny to remove. I also implemented
                the <b>tomato spawning system</b> and made the dragons <b>shoot fire</b>.

                Minnesota Bones is an <b>evil puzzle platformer</b> where you play as the undead
                adventurer
                <b>Minnesota Bones</b>. For an age, Minnesota were sleeping down in their crypt while
                their servers mined crypto currency for them. To their horror, they were <b>corpse-napped</b>
                away in their sleep by greedy archeologists (the British museum?). They now have to return
                to fetch their <b>crypto wallet</b>, while something <b>evil</b> lurks in the deep.
                <br><br>
                The theme for this <b>game jam</b> was <b>duality</b>. It spawned the idea of a
                platformer where you have to first <b>solve puzzles</b> that sets you up for your return.
                It is easy to get down to the <b>crypto wallet</b>, but if you don't think carefully
                about your <b>path</b>, you might not be able to get back. The idea was fun in theory,
                but our game design was <b>outright bad</b>. We thought it was way too funny to not
                give the player hints about the fact that they had to return. We also tried
                actively <b>tricking</b> and <b>trapping</b> players with the <b>puzzles</b>.
                Finally, it was also <b>way too hard</b> overall, and with no <b>checkpoints</b>,
                players just got frustrated. Lesson learned: Fun for the <b>developers</b> doesn't
                necessarily translate into fun for the <b>players</b>.

                <b>Återvänd till Apa</b> is a <b>sudden death action shooter</b> where you
                play as monkeys, running around in a tree, <b>shooting</b> each other
                with bananas. It was our first <b>multiplayer</b> game, which makes it fun by
                definition! I won't get in to too much detail since I wasn't very involved with
                this game. However, the funniest part about it was by far the <b>monkey space
                    program</b>. One of the features was that the monkeys could <b>climb</b> on the
                roofs and walls of the tree. One side effect of this was that they could also
                <b>climb on each other</b>! If two players timed it well and started climbing on
                each other at the same time, they could travel <b>indefinitely</b> into the air.
                We added a <b>moon</b> far above the level just for this purpose as a fun
                <b>easter egg</b>.

                <b>Conjuring Carpentry</b> is a <b>survival tower defence</b> game where you play as a
                carpenter with <b>magical powers</b>. In the daytime, you wander around the woods,
                chopping down trees and crafting beautiful furniture. At night, your creations
                <b>come alive</b> to defend you against the horrors of the forest.
                <br><br>
                I still think the <b>original</b> idea was great, but it was far too ambitious for
                a <b>game jam</b>. Since we barely had time to playtest, the furniture and the waves
                of enemies were very <b>unbalanced</b>. One of the furniture even crashes <b>all enemies</b>
                on the whole map (we still have no idea how that happened). I spent most of my time working
                on the <b>enemy AI</b> and the wave spawning mechanism. On a positive note, I finally managed to get

                <b>Rootwork</b> is a game where you grow <b>roots</b>. That's pretty much it. You put down
                your <b>seeds</b>, the roots grow and you collect more <b>seeds</b>. It is barely a game,
                but it is actually very <b>relaxing</b> to look at. I only wish we would've added <b>music</b>
                to it.
                <br><br>
                It is by far the most simple game we've made thus far, which was intentional since our
                <b>studies</b> were very hectic at the time. I spent the first evening of the jam
                programming the <b>root algorithm</b>. Each <b>root cell</b> essentially checks its
                surroundings for other <b>roots</b>, and tries to grow in the <b>opposite</b> direction,
                which some <b>randomness</b> thrown in. After the catastrophe called <b>Conjuring Carpentry</b>,
                making a simple game was quite nice and it turned out great, mostly because it was so <b>simple</b>.
